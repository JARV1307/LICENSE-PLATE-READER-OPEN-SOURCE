This code use an API from roboflow that can identify where a license plate is in a image, with a very high accuracy.
And also a code was added that depends on the detection of the license plate to perform an image processing and extract the letters from the image and store them, either so that they can be stored in a security database or any other application. It should be noted that it has a format functions that are intended for license plate formats in Spain.
